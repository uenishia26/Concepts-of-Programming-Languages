(* Find square-root 

   Please implement a function `sqrt` of type `int -> int` such that
   when given an integer `n` greater than or equal to 0, it returns its
   square root. For inputs whose square roots are not whole numbers,
   return the smallest number `i` such that `n <= i * i`. 

   Examples with whole square roots:
   sqrt 4 = 2
   sqrt 9 = 3
   sqrt 100 = 10

   Examples without whole square roots:
   sqrt 2 = 2        (smallest number i such that 2 <= i * i is 2)
   sqrt 10 = 4       (smallest number i such that 10 <= i * i is 4)
   sqrt 99 = 10      (smallest number i such that 99 <= i * i is 10) // Testing to make sure that the GitHub is connected
